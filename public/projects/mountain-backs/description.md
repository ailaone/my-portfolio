The Mountain Backs were inspired by the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, which draw a sharp line across the landscape—flat high desert to the east, topographical wonder to the west. Similarly, these bindings feature a smooth back surface that transitions into a mountain range structure, providing extra support where needed. The design embraces geometric variability in both the mountain-like back and interior lattice, allowing bindings to be easily swapped for different rider preferences and conditions.

## Development

A collaboration between Stratasys, Slicelab, and F Equals F produced 3D printed snowboard binding high-backs on the Stratasys Origin One printer using Loctite 3172™ High Impact material. FEA tools created a topology-optimized solution with varying lattice thickness while conforming to the boot. Strategic variations in the Colorado-inspired mountain range geometry provided additional support where needed. The bindings were functionally tested at Breckenridge, Colorado, and performed perfectly.

The prints were oriented to fit a pair within the build volume while requiring only minimal support structure, eliminating post-processing needs. The high-back connects via two pivoting fasteners at the bottom and two ledges that lock onto the binding base rim.

## Performance

These bindings demonstrate high-performance functional parts achievable only with additive manufacturing—geometric complexity too difficult to traditionally injection mold. The Loctite 3172™ material delivers durability, impact resistance, high stiffness, and good surface finish with attributes similar to polypropylene.
