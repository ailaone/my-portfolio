A topology-optimized inline skate frame designed in nTopology for additive manufacturing. The structure was engineered using FEA to withstand extreme skating loads—hard turns, jumps, and rail grinding—while maintaining minimal weight. Strategic gyroid patterns fill low-stress areas between wheels, creating both structural efficiency and visual interest.

## Fabrication

Printed on HP Jet Fusion 580 in PA-12, enabling full-color customization. Two initial designs were developed: a marble texture matching Danny Beer's THEM skates, and a gyroid-based pattern generated through advanced boolean operations in nTopology.

## Customization

Multiple frame variants adapt to different skating styles. The design system allows for endless color patterns and surface textures.
