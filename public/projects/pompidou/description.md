## Overview

Created during the **ComfyUI for Architects: Negotiating Forms** workshop in October 2025 led by Kedar Undale in collaboration with Futurly. With the Centre Pompidou closing for a five-year renovation, this project explores a playful intervention for the iconic plaza: a public pool in summer and an ice rink in winter.

The workshop emphasized moving beyond standalone AI image generation toward real-world architectural interventions through retrofitting and design, integrating open-source AI tools into the architectural process.

## Process

Using Google Earth imagery as a base, the project developed architectural concepts through ComfyUI workflows combining NanoBanana, SeedDream (cloud), and Flux models (local). 3D generation experiments with TripoAI explored volumetric possibilities, though the outputs served primarily as conceptual studies.

*Note: AI tooling has progressed rapidly since this workshop, reflecting the fast-evolving nature of generative design workflows.*
