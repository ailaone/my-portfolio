Product design and development for FreeForm Sports' 3D-printed football thigh pads, created in partnership with Carbon using their Design Engine and additive manufacturing technology. The project leveraged computational design to optimize protective athletic equipment for both performance and safety.

## Technical Approach

As co-founder of slicelab, I led the computational design development for the thigh pads using Carbon's Design Engine. The design utilized advanced lattice structures and topology optimization to create pads that were simultaneously lightweight and impact-resistant. The computational workflow allowed for precise customization based on athlete-specific requirements while maintaining structural integrity across design variations.

## Impact Testing & Results

The 3D-printed FreeForm thigh pads were tested at Ohio State University's Injury Biomechanics Research Center under the supervision of Dr. John Bolte, Medical Advisor to the Big Ten Conference. The computational designs outperformed all existing commercial pads in the market across all impact testing metrics.

## Athlete Adoption

The pads soft-launched in Fall 2022 and were adopted by NCAA athletes from multiple programs, including the Colorado Buffalos and Texas Longhorns. Travis Hunter of Colorado became the first NCAA athlete advisor, and Heisman Trophy winner wearing customized pads featuring his personal TH branding.

Through slicelab, we continue to develop additional FreeForm products and provide manufacturing pipeline consulting for the ongoing partnership.
