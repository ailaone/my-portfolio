Theater redesign for a Florida client under extreme time pressure. Brought in to replace the original designer, we needed fast design direction approval without weeks of traditional rendering.

## Approach

I developed AI-assisted concept sections using ByteDance and NanoBanana to rapidly explore material palettes. Working from Rhino section cuts, I generated collage-style visualizations with intentionally sketchy, cut-paper aesthetics. Two options presented: blue-black-copper and burgundy-wood. Client selected the wood scheme.

## Workflow

Rhino sections were fed to AI models with reference images and LLM-generated prompts. This enabled rapid iteration during crunch time while maintaining spatial and material clarity.

**Example prompt:**

*"Keep the exact geometry and layout of the uploaded section. Do not alter structure or perspective. The left side is the stage—keep it dark and neutral with just enough light to define form. The catwalk and light booth at the top should remain dark with very subtle illumination. Use the reference image for material and color cues: [insert image description here] Render it sharply in an architectural collage style with paper textures, clean cut edges, and strong contrast. Avoid softness or painterly blur. No people or figures."*
