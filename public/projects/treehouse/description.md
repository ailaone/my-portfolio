A suspended geodesic treehouse commissioned by O2 Treehouse for a Glade commercial and Vagabrothers travel blog. Located in California's Coastal Redwood forests, the project required translating conceptual design into a buildable reality suspended 50+ feet above ground.

## Slicelab's Role

Slicelab developed a preliminary SketchUp concept into a fully realized, fabrication-ready design. Working entirely in Rhino, we created comprehensive technical documentation that translated directly to the fabrication shop—the Rhino model served as the single source of truth for all fabrication data.

## Technical Development

The structure consists of 56 laser-cut steel diamond frames in a geodesic dome configuration, creating 360° panoramic views. Each frame was precisely modeled and nested for CNC fabrication, with marine-grade plywood panels fitting the openings. The treehouse is entirely suspended between six Coastal Redwoods with no ground support, requiring careful structural analysis to ensure stability while minimizing tree impact.

## Fabrication Workflow

All fabrication drawings, CNC cutting files, and assembly documentation were generated directly from the Rhino model. This model-to-shop workflow eliminated traditional 2D drafting and ensured geometric accuracy across 56 unique components.
