As Design Director at Francis Bitonti Studio, I led the computational design and technical development for the Mutatio collection. A collaboration with United Nude and 3D Systems. Each shoe was algorithmically generated and uniquely manufactured through SLS 3D printing, gold-plating, and embossed leather uppers.

The design called for a latticed platform heel with complex voronoi-inspired channeling, and flowing geometry that would be both structurally sound and visually striking. The challenge was developing a computational workflow that could generate this intricate woven pattern while maintaining smooth, continuous surfaces suitable for 3D printing and post-processing. Each heel needed to be algorithmically unique, yet manufacturable.

**Maya** handled the core weaving operations, creating complex 3D curve networks that formed the foundation of the latticed structure and defined the channeled geometry.

**Rhino, Grasshopper, and RhinoScript** managed the voronoi-based cellular patterning and algorithmic variation. By adjusting parameters, each heel could be uniquely generated while maintaining the overall design language.

**ZBrush** provided complex boolean operations and targeted surface smoothing, allowing for localized control where parametric tools fell short.

The result was a collection of wearable, algorithmically-generated luxury footwear that positioned computational design as a viable approach for limited-edition goods—creating digital scarcity through unique generative outputs rather than traditional manufacturing constraints.
