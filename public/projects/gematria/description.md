A collection of personalized jewelry pieces based on Hebrew gematria, the ancient practice of assigning numerical values to Hebrew letters. Each medallion is computationally generated to create a unique, meaningful piece for the wearer.

## Computational Design Workflow

Custom Grasshopper workflow that automates the design and customization process for clients. The system translates names or words into Hebrew, calculates their gematria value, and generates the medallion geometry accordingly.

## Two-Sided Design

**Front** — Hebrew letters precisely arranged and engraved, representing the client's chosen name or word.

**Back** — A randomized dot pattern derived from the gematria numerical value. The number of dots corresponds to the calculated value, with each pattern algorithmically generated to ensure every medallion is completely unique.

## Production

The medallions are precision-manufactured in sterling silver or 14K gold in NYC, paired with colored cord bracelets or chains. The computational workflow enables mass customization while maintaining the uniqueness of each piece.
