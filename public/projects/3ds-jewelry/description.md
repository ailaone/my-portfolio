A collaboration with 3D Systems that extended the algorithmic design language developed for the United Nude shoe collection into wearable accessories. Each piece was algorithmically generated and uniquely manufactured through SLS 3D printing with 18k gold plating.

## Design Challenge

The design required intricate latticed structures with voronoi-inspired cellular patterning adapted to jewelry scale. The challenge was maintaining structural integrity and wearability while ensuring each piece remained algorithmically unique and manufacturable as luxury jewelry.

## Computational Workflow

The same algorithmic system from the Mutatio heels was adapted for jewelry production. **Maya** created complex 3D curve networks forming the latticed structure, **Rhino/Grasshopper/RhinoScript** managed voronoi patterning and algorithmic variation, and **ZBrush** provided boolean operations and surface smoothing for wearability.

## Result

The collection demonstrated computational design's viability for luxury goods, creating digital scarcity through unique generative outputs. Each piece is algorithmically distinct—a wearable expression of parametric design at the intersection of technology and craftsmanship.
