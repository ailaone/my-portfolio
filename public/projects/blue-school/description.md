Every space—from classrooms to hallways—creates opportunities for both planned and spontaneous group learning. Custom non-directional trapezoidal desks enable multiple configurations for individual study or collaborative work. Each classroom includes raised carpeted platforms for presentations and quiet reading.

## Key Spaces
