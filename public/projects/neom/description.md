A fast-paced architectural competition for NEOM's Red Sea coastline, exploring two distinct housing typologies for Saudi Arabia's desert coastal landscape. The project emphasized rapid concept development under tight deadlines.

## The Twist

A sculptural residential concept featuring flowing, organic geometry in terracotta tones. The ribbon-like form creates continuous interior spaces responding to views, sun orientation, and prevailing winds, with integrated pools and terraces that blur boundaries between built and natural environment.

## The Lilypad

A modular pavilion system of circular units with varied dome configurations. The design aggregates individual pods into flexible compounds, each incorporating solar panels, green roofs, or water features. Connecting pools and pathways create shaded outdoor living spaces while minimizing site impact.

## Visualization

Twinmotion enabled rapid photorealistic rendering under competition deadlines, allowing quick iterations on materials, lighting, and landscaping while maintaining presentation quality critical for concept communication.
