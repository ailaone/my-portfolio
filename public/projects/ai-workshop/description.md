A two-part workshop series introducing architecture and design students to AI-assisted design workflows, exploring visualization, 3D modeling, and hybrid computational processes.

## Workshop Structure

**Part 1: Visualization & Image Generation** — Introduction to AI models (language, visual, video, 3D) and practical demonstrations of visualization tools including Vizcom, Adobe Creative Suite with Firefly, and node-based workflow systems. Focus on sketch-to-render workflows, image generation, and systematic design exploration.

**Part 2: 3D Workflows** — Advanced applications exploring AI-assisted 3D modeling processes, including hybrid workflows that combine AI generation with traditional CAD refinement. Demonstrations of text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and integrated visualization pipelines similar to the Vizcom furniture study.

## Tools Covered

- **Vizcom** — Node-based platform with sketch-to-render, 3D generation, and video capabilities (free for educational accounts)
- **Adobe Creative Suite** — Photoshop 2025 with integrated AI tools (Firefly, Imagen 3)
- **Midjourney** — Advanced text-to-image and image-to-video generation platform
- **Weavy** — Advanced node-based workflow system for chaining multiple AI models
- **ComfyUI** — Open-source, locally-run alternative for full control and privacy

## Approach

The workshop emphasizes practical integration of AI tools into existing design processes rather than replacement of traditional skills. Focus on understanding model types, building repeatable workflows, and maintaining design intent while leveraging AI for rapid iteration and exploration.
