A generative AI experiment exploring album cover aesthetics using RunwayML's StyleGAN2. The project trained on 780 album covers from my personal vinyl collection to generate entirely new cover designs through latent space exploration.

## Dataset & Training

The training set spanned various genres, eras, and design styles—from vintage jazz sleeves to contemporary electronic music artwork. Images were preprocessed to square format and fed into StyleGAN2 to learn the visual language of record cover design: typography, color palettes, compositional structures, and the interplay between imagery and graphic design.

## Results

The model generated novel covers that captured album design conventions—centered compositions, bold typography placement, and characteristic color treatments—while creating entirely new combinations.

A notable pattern emerged: the model showed a strong tendency toward grid-based compositions and structured layouts, reflecting both the prevalence of grid systems in album cover design and potentially inherent biases in generative models. Many outputs featured segmented compositions, repeating elements, and modular arrangements.

Latent space walks revealed smooth transitions between design styles, with outputs ranging from photographic to abstract.
