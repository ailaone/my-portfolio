Exploration of high-resolution 3D printing for jewelry fabrication during the 2015 Autodesk Residency Program at Pier 9.

## Focus

Pushed the limits of additive manufacturing in jewelry production using the Autodesk Ember DLP 3D printer. Developed four collections inspired by the suspended weightlessness of delicate marine life, with printed designs used directly as investments for traditional lost-wax casting.

## Nexus Collection

Featured collection exploring precise yet unpredictable line networks found in natural forms. Series included earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets that translated organic complexity into wearable computational geometry.
