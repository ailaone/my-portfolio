## Part 01: Controlled Randomization

Techniques for generating organic weaving and patterning systems using Sub-D geometry converted to meshes. Core workflow: randomized planes and vectors intersect meshes to generate curves, with randomness controlled through centroids, bounding boxes, and remapped domains. Depth and material behavior added by manipulating curve points along surfaces with controlled noise. Strategic plugin use (Weaverbird, Pufferfish, Hoopsnake) for mesh subdivision and performance. Framed as representational and conceptual tools for visualization rather than literal construction documentation.

## Part 02: Animation + Rendering

Camera animation as extension of parametric thinking. Covers native Rhino tools (path animation, turntable) and Grasshopper-driven camera control via Hoster Camera Control. Slider-based animation logic links design parameters directly to camera motion and time-based representation. Export workflows using Photoshop timeline, TapeWorm (FFMPEG-based), and OBS for real-time capture.

**Target Audience**: Intermediate Grasshopper users exploring computational design for concept development and visualization.
