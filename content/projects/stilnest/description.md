A limited-edition digital jewelry collection developed in collaboration with Stilnest, exploring branching algorithms and computational geometry to create unique, one-of-a-kind pieces manufactured through 3D printing.

## Design System

Each piece was generated through branching algorithms developed in MATLAB, creating organic, tree-like structures with natural variation. The system ensured every piece was geometrically distinct—each design was generated once and never replicated, creating authentic digital scarcity.

## Manufacturing

Pieces were manufactured on-demand through Stilnest's digital jewelry platform, demonstrating how algorithmic design and additive manufacturing could produce luxury goods with computational complexity impossible to achieve through traditional methods.
