Limited-edition digital jewelry collection in collaboration with WonderLuk. The collection explored algorithmic design and artificial intelligence to create truly unique, one-of-a-kind pieces manufactured through 3D printing and traditional jewelry finishing.

## Algorithmic Design System

Each piece was generated through a complex algorithm that created personalized variations within a defined design language. The system utilized artificial intelligence to shape organic, fluid forms that ensured every piece was geometrically distinct. Rather than traditional mass production, each design was generated once and never replicated—creating authentic digital scarcity.

## Collection Structure

The collection included four jewelry types: bracelet cuffs, rings, pendants, and earrings. For each type, the algorithm generated exactly 30 unique variants, with no two pieces sharing the same geometry. After 3D printing, each piece was hand-finished by professional jewelers, combining computational design with traditional craftsmanship.

## Manufacturing & Distribution

The collection demonstrated how algorithmic design and additive manufacturing could produce luxury goods that would be impossible to replicate through traditional methods while maintaining the exclusivity expected in high-end jewelry.
