iSnap is a lightweight macOS screenshot + instant markup tool built for speed.

It was 99% vibe-coded using Antigravity as an experiment to test its capabilities.

It’s designed for live reviews, design calls, and quick feedback loops — capture a region, copy it to the clipboard, save it to disk, and immediately annotate without breaking your flow.

What started as a small frustration-driven side project turned into a fully working tool built through vibe-coding, real use, and iterative tinkering.
