## Talk Overview

"Advancing Sports Equipment Through Computational Craftsmanship" demonstrated Slicelab's end-to-end pipeline for performance-focused design. Focused on balancing automation with human intuition where algorithms enhance rather than replace designer intent, ensuring complexity serves purpose and designs remain manufacturable.

## Key Topics

- Three-pillar approach: Design at all scales, computational craftsmanship, product development
- End-to-end workflow: concept studies through topology optimization, parametric exploration, lattice development, material simulation, and physical testing
- Software-agnostic pipeline: Procreate/Vizcom/Rhino for ideation, nTopology for optimization, Grasshopper for parametric workflows
- Design space exploration with adjustable parameters enabling rapid iteration

Featured case studies: topology-optimized inline skate frame, Mountain Back snowboard highbacks, and Freeform Sports customizable padding system for NCAA and NFL athletes.
