Slicelab was part of the 2015 Autodesk Residency Program at Pier 9. 

The focus was mainly on pushing the limits of the 3D printing capabilities within the Jewelry making process using the now defunct Autodesk Ember 3D Printer. 
During that period, 4 jewelry collections were developed that were inspired by the suspended weightlessness of delicate marine life. The printed designs were directly used as investments for the traditional lost wax casting. 

The Nexus Collection was the highlighted collection and included a series of earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets inspired by a complex set of precise yet unpredictable lines found in the natural world.
