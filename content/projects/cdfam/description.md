## Talk Overview

"Design at all Scales Through Computational Craftsmanship" explored how Slicelab integrates digital design with additive manufacturing, from inline skate frames to NCAA athletic padding systems. Emphasized design-first methodology where computational tools serve creative vision rather than dictate it.

## Key Topics

- Cross-scale design strategies informed by architectural background
- Rapid prototyping workflows that bridge digital and physical craftsmanship
- 3MF file metadata for production traceability
- Platform selection: Rhino/Grasshopper for parametric workflows, Maya for sculptural forms, nTopology for complex lattice structures

Featured work included topology-optimized sports equipment, customizable padding systems, and experimental furniture collections—all demonstrating how tactile material exploration drives computational development.
