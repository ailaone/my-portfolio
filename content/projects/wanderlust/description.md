Multi-programmatic entertainment complex located within Les Docks - Cité de la Mode et du Design, overlooking the Seine River. The project transforms a 2000m² terrace into an urban experiment blending restaurant, nightclub, open-air cinema, and event space.

## Design Concept

Wanderlust materializes a sense of *provisoire*—experimental programming and urban eclecticism designed to evoke discovery, escape, and humor. The architecture embraces informal, temporary spatial qualities while maintaining sophisticated computational fabrication.

## Key Elements

**Tensile Pavilion**: Freeform steel frame structure with chartreuse Ferrari membrane housing bar, restrooms, DJ booth, and projection space. Computer-developed geometry creates a striking visual anchor for the platform.

**Cinema Structure**: Cantilevered steel screen support for 2D/3D projection, designed to hang "crab-like" from the neighboring building.

**Material Palette**: Ipe decking, iroko wood slatted furniture, and green-painted steel structures establish a rustic yet refined vocabulary—*vernacular provisoire* adapted for contemporary urban context.
