As course coordinator for Visualization 3 at New York Institute of Technology's School of Architecture and Design, I oversee the curriculum and guide section instructors in teaching advanced 3D modeling and visualization skills to undergraduate architecture students.

## Course Overview

Visualization 3 develops students' ability to model spatial, volumetric, and tectonic conditions digitally, bridging the gap between digital design and physical realization. The course supports the core architecture curriculum while addressing contemporary digital design and fabrication processes.

## Curriculum Structure

As coordinator, I developed a progressive five-assignment sequence that builds technical proficiency:

**AI-Driven Design Exploration** — Students use AI image generation tools (Vizcom) to explore architectural forms and terminology, then translate these explorations into SubD 3D models.

**Pavilion & Landscape Design** — Group project applying subdivision surface modeling to design a site-specific pavilion with integrated landscape, emphasizing formal exploration and contextual response.

**Structural Systems** — Evolution of pavilion design into detailed structural components, exploring seams, joints, creases, and material articulation through SubD modeling.

**Digital-to-Physical Translation** — Multi-method fabrication exploration using 3D printing, CNC milling, and laser cutting, paired with digital simulations and rendering in Enscape.

**Digital Portfolio** — Semester-long portfolio development focusing on composition, layout, graphic design, and professional presentation standards.
