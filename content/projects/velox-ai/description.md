A concept running shoe combining AI-generated design with additive manufacturing, inspired by roadrunner biomechanics. The project explores AI, computational design, and sustainable materials in footwear.

## AI-Generated Upper

The 3D knit upper was designed entirely through AI, analyzing roadrunner biomechanics to generate an intricate pattern balancing aesthetics with function. The pattern adapts to foot contours for tailored fit and breathability.

Manufactured from recycled polyester, the upper champions sustainability by repurposing post-consumer materials. Working with Variant3D and their development team, we tested various stiffness maps, material thicknesses, and knit patterns to achieve optimal fit and performance.

## Computational Midsole Design

The midsole features a parametrically-designed lattice structure optimized for even pressure distribution. Using a voxel-based system, the lattice responds to pressure mapping data, adjusting cell density, thickness, and orientation based on load requirements.

## Collaboration

Developed in partnership with **VARIANT3D**, with additional collaboration from **F=F** and **Stratasys** (formerly Origin Laboratories) for materials research and additive manufacturing expertise.
