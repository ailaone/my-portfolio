A concept running shoe combining AI-generated design with additive manufacturing, inspired by the speed and agility of the roadrunner bird. The project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, computational design, and sustainable materials in footwear development.

## AI-Generated Upper

The defining feature is the 3D knit upper, designed entirely through artificial intelligence. The system analyzed the roadrunner's biomechanics and form to generate an intricate 3D knit pattern that balances aesthetics with function. The pattern adapts to the wearer's foot contours, providing a tailored fit while maintaining breathability.

The upper is manufactured from recycled polyester, championing sustainability by repurposing post-consumer materials and reducing waste in the production process. Working with product developers and factory engineers in Asia, various stiffness maps, material thicknesses, and knit patterns were tested to achieve optimal fit and performance in prototype samples.

## Computational Midsole Design

The midsole features a parametrically-designed lattice structure optimized for even pressure distribution across the footbed. Developed using a voxel-based system, the lattice responds to pressure mapping data and adjusts cell density, thickness, and orientation based on load requirements.

FEA testing on resin 3D printed prototypes informed the structural properties of each cell, with variations in beam angle and thickness creating different compression and shear characteristics. The triangulated mesh pattern allows for variable cell sizing that wouldn't be achievable through traditional grid morphing, creating denser areas under high-stress zones and sparser regions for flexibility.

## Collaboration

Developed in partnership with **VARIANT3D**, with additional collaboration from **F=F** and **Stratasys** (formerly Origin Laboratories) for materials research and additive manufacturing expertise.
