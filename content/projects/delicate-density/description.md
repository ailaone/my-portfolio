## Overview

A concrete exploration using 3D printed molds to investigate how delicate and detailed concrete can be while maintaining structural rigidity. This R&D project pushed the material's natural limitations through fine geometries, creating a piece of furniture that embodies an optimal balance of delicateness in form and strength in density.

**Collaboration:** Concrete Works
**Dimensions:** 152.5 × 45.5 × 38 cm (5' × 1½' × 15")
**Weight:** 86 kg (190 lbs)
**Material:** Ultra-High-Performance White Concrete

## Process

The digital model was broken into 23 PLA plastic molds totaling 66 lbs, created on a standard FDM printer. Generative design and topological optimization in Rhino and Fusion 360, alongside form-finding in Maya, enabled substantial weight reduction and freedom of form.

The 5ft mold was designed to withstand 300 lbs of reinforced concrete and vibration table stress. Assembly order proved critical for achieving a sealed cavity. The mold was poured upside down to create a porous underside and smooth top surface.

Concrete flowed through 3 openings into 10 legs to fill the cavity. Hydrostatic pressure caused bursts requiring constant repairs with drilling, tape, epoxy, and clamps. The break-away mold was removed piece by piece, with 3D print striations wet sanded smooth.

This 18-month R&D project will inform the next scaled-up version with reusable molds.
