Feetz was a Tennessee-based startup pioneering custom 3D printed footwear using a proprietary recyclable filament called NoogaFlex. The company's approach combined iPhone-based foot scanning technology with on-demand additive manufacturing to create custom-fit shoes tailored to each customer's unique foot shape.

As a member of the early design team, I developed multiple footwear designs optimized for 3D printing and led design development alongside Francis Bitonti Studio. Our collaboration produced several footwear concepts, including the Sphere design, which explored computational design methods and novel material applications for printed footwear.

The work combined material research, parametric design, and manufacturing workflows to create flexible, breathable polymer footwear that could be produced in hours rather than weeks. In 2015, the project was featured in Fast Company, recognized as a Wearable Technology Finalist at SXSW, and showcased at the 3D Print Fashion Show in New York.

The company no longer exists.
