A design exploration investigating AI-assisted furniture development workflows using Vizcom's sketch-to-render and 3D generation capabilities.

## Process

The study tested a hybrid workflow combining AI generation with traditional 3D modeling:

**Initial Design** — Conceptual sketches developed and rendered in Vizcom, exploring form variations and material treatments through AI-assisted visualization.

**3D Development** — AI-generated models exported and refined in Rhino, cleaning up geometry, adjusting proportions, and resolving technical details for manufacturability.

**Final Visualization** — Refined 3D models reimported into Vizcom for integrated rendering, combining the precision of CAD modeling with the speed and aesthetic quality of AI rendering.

## Findings

The workflow demonstrates the potential of integrating AI tools into traditional design processes, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining geometric control and technical precision in final outputs.
