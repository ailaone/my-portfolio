Located on Rambaud quay overlooking the Saône river in Lyon's La Confluence district. The building features an acid-green perforated aluminum facade with two large egg-shaped atriums that penetrate through all six floors.

## Facade Pattern Development

Collaborated with artist Fabrice Hyber to translate his "tourbillons" sketches into a performative facade system. Pattern development used Scriptographer plug-in for Illustrator CS5, then Rhino for rationalization and adaptation across building zones, and AutoCAD for final cut files.

**Panel Rationalization**: 118 unique panel types for 880 total panels. Main floors limited to 5 unique panels where large cone-shaped atriums penetrate. Ground floor and rooftop feature 41 unique panels each. 1st floor and 5th floor feature 14 and 17 respectively with adapted perforation density for increased visibility and reduced wind resistance.

## Technical Constraints

Perforations strategically positioned to balance structural performance, wind loads, and visual transparency. Hexagonal perforation pattern coordinated with facade motif to maintain aluminum panel strength. Added acoustic dampeners and structural tie-backs in solid areas to minimize wind-induced movement.

**Workflow**: Each panel designed individually requiring manual iteration across hundreds of variations. Pattern tolerances maintained through iterative adjustment processes—completed before adopting parametric tools like Grasshopper.
