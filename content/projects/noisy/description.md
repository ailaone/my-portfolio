Music and Dance Conservatory in Noisy-le-Sec, a Parisian suburb, consolidating five programs into a 2,500m² facility serving 1,000 students. As Lead Designer at Jakob+MacFarlane, I developed and coordinated the triangulated aluminum facade system, bridging design intent with fabrication reality through direct collaboration with facade engineers and their CATIA models.

## Design Strategy

The faceted geometry eliminates parallel walls, establishing superior acoustics throughout teaching spaces. Street-facing facades use poured concrete; courtyard facades combine glass and thermo-lacquered aluminum panels. An open central staircase creates shared "urban" space connecting dance studios, music rehearsal rooms, and an adaptable 200-seat auditorium.

## Acoustic Innovation

The multi-use auditorium features sliding wooden panels and ceiling-mounted orientable elements that reconfigure for three acoustic scenarios: amplified music, classical performance, and dance. This system allows real-time adjustment of reverberation time to match performance requirements.
